# Intel Headers
How many times did you have to copy structures/constants from Intel PDFs and/or other specs?
If your answer is more than once, then this project is for you!

We at [Viral Security Group](https://www.vsecgroup.com) work closely with the 
Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual 
on a daily basis, and we had to copy things from it countless times. No more!

In this project we aim to define all of Intel's structures and constants in one place,
that you can later include in your projects.

The code is published under the MIT license, since we want as many developers as possible
to enjoy the "fruits of our labor" and avoid the arduous chore of copy-pasting from the 
Intel spec on every new project.

We are happy to accept contibutions, just make sure you follow the code conventions, 
specify in a comment from where you got the structure/constant and of course add 
yourself to the contibutors.txt file :)
